# üåô LunaPhase √úbersicht Widget

Displays the current moon phase, illumination, and other lunar details in √úbersicht on macOS. Automatically refreshes twice a day and visualizes data with a themed interface and a moon image.

## Requirements

### macOS System
- macOS with [√úbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) installed

### Node.js Environment
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (required for lunar calculations)
- Node module: `suncalc`

### Shell Script
- `script.sh` generates moon data, timestamp, and image
- Must be executable:
  ```sh
  chmod +x LunaPhase.widget/script.sh
  ```

## Setting Up Node.js Support (`suncalc`)

This widget uses the [`suncalc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc) Node.js module to calculate moon phases and illumination.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Install Node.js** (if not already installed)  
   On macOS, use Homebrew:
   ```sh
   brew install node
   ```

2. **Navigate to the widget folder**  
   ```sh
   cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/UÃàbersicht/widgets/LunaPhase.widget
   ```

3. **Initialize the folder as a Node project**
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install `suncalc`**
   ```sh
   npm install suncalc
   ```

5. **Ensure `script.sh` is executable**
   ```sh
   chmod +x script.sh
   ```

6. **Run `script.sh` manually to generate moon data**
   ```sh
   ./script.sh
   ```

## üåî How the Widget Chooses the Moon Phase Image

The widget uses `suncalc` to calculate the current moon phase as a value from `0.0` to `1.0`, which is then mapped to one of eight common moon phases:

```js
const moonPhases = [
  "New Moon", "Waxing Crescent", "First Quarter",
  "Waxing Gibbous", "Full Moon", "Waning Gibbous",
  "Last Quarter", "Waning Crescent"
];

const phaseIndex = Math.floor(moonIllumination.phase * 8);
const moonPhase = moonPhases[phaseIndex];
```

## Moon Image Selection

The image shown in the widget (`tmp/current_moon.png`) reflects the current north hemisphere moon phase. The south hemisphere images are not included.

### Static Moon Phase Images (Included)

This widget currently uses a set of **pre-downloaded static images** for each moon phase. These were originally sourced from NASA‚Äôs [Daily Moon Guide](https://moon.nasa.gov/moon-observation/daily-moon-guide) and manually matched to approximate phase names.

These images are **not dynamically updated**, but they are **visually accurate and close enough** for most casual users.

Example usage:
```sh
cp images/${moonPhase}.png tmp/current_moon.png
```

### Extend It Yourself (If you like)

Advanced users can modify the widget to fetch **daily-updated images from NASA** using their public web assets.

Suggested pattern:
```sh
TODAY=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
curl -o tmp/current_moon.png "https://moon.nasa.gov/system/feature_items/images/${TODAY}-moon.png"
```

**Note**: This logic is **not implemented by default**, but you can build it into `script.sh` if desired.


## Fonts & Styling

- Uses the `Epilogue` font family
- Font files (`.woff2`) must exist in `fonts/` and be referenced correctly
- The moon image is displayed in a circular frame with styled text overlays

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Cannot find module 'suncalc'` | `suncalc` not installed | Run `npm install suncalc` in the widget directory |
| `script.sh not found or not executable` | Missing or bad permissions | Run `chmod +x script.sh` |
| Moon data is blank | `moon_data` not generated | Manually run `./script.sh` and check `tmp/` output |
| Fonts not working | Missing or misnamed `.woff2` files | Check file paths and `font-family` references |
| No moon image | Image not created | Ensure `script.sh` creates `tmp/current_moon.png` |


## Quick Summary

- Install Node.js and `suncalc`
- Run `script.sh` to generate moon data and image
- √úbersicht renders output from `moon_data`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `current_moon.png`
- Image can be static or fetched from NASA‚Äôs Moon Guide
